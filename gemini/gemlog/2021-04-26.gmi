# Plans

> In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable.  - General Dwight D. Eisenhower 

As part of my day job I'm a big part of our team's planning process. And a common complaint I hear is along the lines of "we made all these plans and suddenly they're all gone! Why even bother?" 

And I think about Eisenhower's quote above. Why do we plan for things? Because that's how we learn. Until we've planned out what we think we're going to do we have no idea what we're trying to do. We are facing ghosts, undefined concepts and a pile of questions. When we plan, we collapse all all those questions into decisions. 

And then things change, sure. But when things change we know where we were before the change. We can use the information we gained to better understand our new reality.
