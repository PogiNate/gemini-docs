# Post-Thanksgiving ðŸ¦ƒ

After Thanksgiving I tend to spend a little time taking it easy, especially this year. 

My favorite thing to do after the Turkey Day is watch Mystery Science Theater 3000. I've been a fan of the show since forever, and it's nice to "spend time" with the cast, in old, safe, comfortable memories. 

So I decided to watch "The Skydivers" this year. I forgot how hilariously bad that episode is; not because of the MST3K part, but because of the hideously bad movie they were riffing that week. So many glances. So much angst. So much coffee. 

## NaNoWriMo 

My novel for NaNoWriMo is actually already "done" this year, which was weird; I still have a few thousand words to go to hit my 50,000 word goal. So I'm playing around with the characters.

I had a lot more fun with NaNoWriMo this year than usual; I have a very active writing buddy who gave me a lot of encouragement and advice along the way, it made it more fun to write when I knew someone was reading along. 

According to write.as, roughly 100 people have read most of the chapters I posted, which is an odd thing.

I don't remember if I submitted my URL or not, but I just checked, and I'm listed on the Gemini Universal Search! That's fun.
