Thursday is always a bummer.

I'm working through schedules for my job for the rest of the year and trying not to feel like work schedules are pointless this time of year. Because they are. I can say that here, nobody I work with uses Gemini. 

## VR

My son bought a VR headset recently with his allowance/chore money. And it's pretty cool! Some games use it really well, but the complaint everyone has about VR is still accurate: it doens't have a killer app that makes it worthwhile. My son loves Beat Saber, which is a cool game, but honestly it's just fruit ninja in 3D. I have been playing The Tetris Effect on his device, and while it's cool it's not any more or less engaging than the Tetris Effect on a regular PC. 

## Writing In December

I have done very little fiction writing thus far. I'm trying to get back into it (I guess it's only the third) but it's harder without the ol' deadline.
