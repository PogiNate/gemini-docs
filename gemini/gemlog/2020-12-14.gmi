## They Might Be Giants

Listening to a fair amount of TMBG lately. I've loved them since I was young, of course. But what impresses me most about them is that they have kept innovating and changing over all the years. They have some themes that run through their ouvre, of course, but they are consistently trying new things, exanding their art. 

I've noticed a while ago that there are certain bands that seem to keep going for as long as they are alive. They are in it for the art more than the money. 

## Writing in December

December is a pain; there's so much going on, and it's hard to write as much as I want to, but I've been working on a D&D Campaign and also trying to update my novel from November. I'm really invested in actually selling this one for real, we'll see if I actually get there. 

I'm also turning it into a setting for a D&D campaign, because if I've learned anything from Douglas Adams its that you should never waste anything. 

## Chess

I'm trying to learn chess again. I've never been great at it, but every few years I decide I'm going to try and get better. This is one of those times. I've been playing around on chess.com, because it's online and easy and free. 

Chess is such a different proposition from regular video games. In chess you're building a real skill, you're building an ability to see deeper and more complex sets of information, and it takes a long time. But having chess as a way to teach myself patience (as well as learning, you know, chess) feels like a good thing.
