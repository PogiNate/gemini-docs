# Nate's Gemini Capsule

The domain name is one I had laying around after not using it for anything interesting for a while. Now I'm using it for a little Gemini Capsule of my very own.

## Gemini Stuff!
I wrote a Syntax thingy for Gemini for Panic's Nova editor. I'm using it right now! You can check it out if you use Nova. Gemfiles are a great syntax to experiment on.

## About the Site

This whole thing is running on Jetforce, which I quite like so far!
At present it's hosted on a Raspberry Pi, which is doing the job quite nicely. I might move to something fancier in the near future. We'll see.
