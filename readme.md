# Gemini Documents

This is a simple little repo for a bunch of documents I want to put on a [Gemini](https://gemini.circumlunar.space/) server. Keeping them here makes it easier to move around, which I'll probably do quite a bit, at least at first. 

## Contributing
Um... if you want to offer spell checking advice and whatnot,  you can do that!

## Find this in real life
If you want to read these documents the way they were *meant* to be read, i.e. with minimal highlighting and whatnot, find them using your favorite gemini browser at [Writerfriends.space](gemini://writerfriends.space)
