## Birthday! ðŸŽ‚ ðŸ¥³

It was my birthday yesterday. Which is fun for me, not really interesting for you. Although here's a fun fact, kind of. My wife and I did the math. 

I was born on Pearl Harbor Day. The span of time between the bombing of Pearl Harbor and my birth is shorter than the span of time between my birth and now. So yeah, gettin' old. 

## D&D

It may not surprise anyone on Gemini that I'm a nerd. We all are! I'm putting together a D&D campaign, and looking forward to it. It's been a long time since I've been looking forward to anything, what with this depressing year and all. But I've been working with a therapist and my wife and stuff and getting my mojo back. So the fact that I want to plan and run a campaign is good news.
