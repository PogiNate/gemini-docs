Hmmm, what's going on today? 

## D&D With Friends! 

I'm starting a friends campaign in D&D. I've been runnning a family campaign with my kids for a while now, which is an exercise in creative lateral thinking, mostly beccause I'm trying to run a game that is fun for a five year old and a fifteen year old at the same time.
