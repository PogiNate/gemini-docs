Hey welcome to the new year! I took the last couple of weeks just being with my family, but now that I'm back at work I am also writing in my spare time, trying to get back to something approaching "normal". 

## Better Off? 

So here's the question; Am I better off today than I was six months ago?

I'm asking this because I'm focusing on positivity and optimism, partially because it's been suggested by a mental health care professional that I do, and partially because I try to be an optimistic person in general. 

But the answer is, well, yes, I think I am. This is mostly because I've spent all this time in quarantine trying to improve my lot in life, spending time focusing on what matters most. Since being diagnosed with diabetes four months ago I've been taking more control over my health and diet, which means that, while I got here by a bad route, I'm in better physical shape than I was. Due to the pandemic giving me all kinds of stress (sound familiar?) I've started going to therapy, meaning I'm in better mental shape than I used to be. 

I realize my experience isn't universal; many people are far, FAR worse off now than they were, and it's my responsibility to do what I can to help those people. But I guess sometimes we can grow and benefit when things go bad. 

Or something. I don't know. 

## Family D&D Update

During the holiday break I took the opportunity to run some D&D sessions for my kids. I'm getting my feet back under me as a DM, and the kids are quite forgiving party members. 

The funniest thing to happen in the campaign was when I asked my five year old daughter for her action in a combat round. She said "hmmmm. I forgive the bandit." As a father I was touched, of course. She DOES listen to us! As a DM I decided that was good for 1d4, which was enough to put the bandit out of commission. He walked out of the tavern and she got her XP.
