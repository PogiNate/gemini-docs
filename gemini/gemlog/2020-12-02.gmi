It's December! ðŸŽ„

I always love this month, not just because I was born this month, not just because I love Christmas and all it entails, but because I really love winter, I love cold outdoor weather and warm, cozy indoor "weather" like herbal tea and whatnot.

My holiday traditions are going to be somewhat different this year because of all the "being diabetic" I'm suddenly doing. So my wife and I are learning how to cook low carb and interesting foods. 

## Hey what about that novel?

I'm still working on my NaNoWriMo novel for 2020, albeit much slower now. I don't have a word goal, just goals for quality improvements. I'm working on putting together a timeline for the story, because it really helps me understand how things fit together when I can see them laid out properly. 

If you want to read my lil' novel from this year you can check it out. I put it all up on write.as, and you can download it as an epub file.
