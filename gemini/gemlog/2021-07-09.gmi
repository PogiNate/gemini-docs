# Is this thing on?

Hey, how's it going? It's...it's been a while, huh?

I'm getting back into this, part of the problme is that I lost my previous computer setup, including all my repositories and whatnot, and it's been a bit of work to get them all set up again. The nice thing is that getting this particular repo set up was a piece of cake, and I have everything automated to pull these into the repo when I make changes.

I'm in a new position at work, with the same company, but now I'm a manager type. I've "put on the tie" as they used to say. I don't know if anyone still says that.
