## This First Part is Complainy, Jump to the Next Heading to Skip.

I was diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic near the beginning of October. Since then I've been trying to take everything very seriously so that I don't get worse. And that's been going well!

Except you know what? The meds they put you on to manage diabetes are pretty nightmarish for your digestive system. This is more or less on purpose, you need to get your digestion re-configured a bit, type 2 is basically a problem in digesting sugars. So I'm feeling pretty good most of the time, except when I'm feeling awful.

## NaNoWriMo 

Okay, happier stuff now. 

I love NaNoWriMo. It's a silly, insane, happy time to just write a silly first draft. Yes it should ideally lead to a second draft and possibly even publishing a book, but I'm less and less bound by that desire these days. Right now I'm enjoying the act of writing, of even wanting to write or do anything creative. It's been a hard year and having a creative outlet is such a relief. 

## Computer Build

My best friend is rebuilding his PC and it's getting me thinking that it might be time to build a new PC myself. My current home-built machine is 8 years old, and still does quite well for most things, but is starting to get a bit rattly and out of date. It's always fun to look at new parts and pieces that are out there, to see what new machines people have made, and what advancements have been made in making cases easier to deal with. My friend's build has no drive cables, as he's using an M2 SSD for his system drive and no optical drive. That sounds far too pleasant.
