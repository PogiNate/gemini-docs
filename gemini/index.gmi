# Nate's Gemini Capsule

The domain name is one I had laying around after not using it for anything interesting for a while. Now I'm using it for a little Gemini Capsule of my very own.

At present this is being hosted on a Raspberry Pi 4 living in my house, I'm looking to change that. Not that I don't love my little Pi, it's just the whole security implications of having a real domain name pointed right at my face.

Running on Jetforce, which I quite like so far!
