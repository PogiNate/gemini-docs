# 24 Apr, 2021 

Today I have:

* Come home from camping
* Fixed my iMac that got shut down mid-update on Friday
* Upgraded my Xubuntu install on my Raspberry Pi 400 to 21.04
* Made a cool water meter using said Raspberry Pi and an arduino. Mostly just to show my kids how you do that.
* Finished a "Renner" clock with 3D Printed stand.

I'd call that just about good enough for the day.
