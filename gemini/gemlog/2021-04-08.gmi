# The Law of Tech 

I've heard it said that there's a rule, called the "Law of Engineering" or similar. It states that if a thing is possible, the price of that thing will eventually drop to effectively free. This article is my experience with that law.

## Then

In high school my best friend and I worked together to build a pair of computers, one for him, one for me. These were genuine hacker boxes, big ugly beige towers, wonky hex screws, the works. The price per machine was around $1400 in 199X dollars. We had both saved from our jobs for a WHILE to build them. 

Of course I don't remember the exact specs, but they were something like:
* 486 DX2/66 CPU (aka 66Mhz processor speed)
* Some RAM (probably 16MB)
* 500 MB Hard Drive
* 3.5" floppy drive
* 5.25" floppy drive (backwards compatibility!)
* 4X CD-ROM (not DVD, and not RW)
* SoundBlaster Audio card
* 56K modem
* Video Card? What's that???

We both already had VGA monitors. 
And we were pretty happy with the machines we built! 

## Now

I currently have 4 or 5 Raspberrys Pi running in my house doing various things. A Raspberry Pi Zero W costs about $10, and is a better computer in every way than the machine I built in high school (other than the disk drives). 
* 1Ghz CPU
* 512MB RAM
* 8/16/32 GB SD card (depending on what I have laying around when I start the project)
* built-in audio that is good enough for what I do with these machines, or a HAT that does excellent audio
* Wi-fi
* Video card? Kinda? but HDMI out that pushes far more pixels than my 640x480 monitor in high school.

I realize this is mostly just me sounding old, sometimes it feels wasteful to use ALL THAT POWER to run a small 12 key keyboard, or an ad blocker, or a Gemini capsule that gets a few visitors a day. Shouldn't I be using all those wasted cycles? Shouldn't I use less powerful hardware to free up those cycles for some other purpose? 

But honestly, an Arduino style board is usually MORE than $5, and is less flexible. It's often the right tool for the job, but a Raspberry Pi Zero is just so useful. I'm good at Linux admin, I can handle setting up a headless machine over ssh and keeping it safe and secure while it does whatever task I give it.
