# Habit

At this point NaNoWriMo is a habit. 

I do it instinctively, it's just a background part of who I am. 
And honestly I don't see a problem with that; NaNoWriMo is a fun and harmless way to be creative once a year and has occasionally led me to other writing projects that have been nominally profitable. 

But every year I feel like I should be making "progress" with my writing; that my works should be taking on more meaning or more life. I should be publishing, getting famous,  you know, living the American dream. 

I don't know if there's really a need or a reason to try to climb that specific ladder, I don't need to be famous or rich or whatever. I need to be happy. I would like to have people read my works.

But it's fairly clear, based on my behaviors, that I'm not actually all that concerned with other people reading what I write.
