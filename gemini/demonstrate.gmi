This page is mostly here so I can take screen shots of it when/if I update my Gemini highlighter thing for Nova. It shows all the features of .gmi files!

> Quoted Text

## Second Level Tests:

Testing code block symbols in a mid-line: shouldn't trigger: ```. Should not look fenced.

```fence with hints
This should be fenced
``` 
 
Also can't start a quote mid-line: > This should look normal, not quoted.
